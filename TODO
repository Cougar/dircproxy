	* Bugzilla #5
	  dircproxy doesn't squelch replies to nick guard code

	  The nick guard code generates NICK commands, it should set a
	  squelch_nick or something after doing this:

	  On receipt of a NICK command, it can decrement squelch_nick
	  (but still pass it through to the client)

	  On receipt of a 433 or similar, it can squelch it.

	* Bugzilla #6
	  incorrect log-flush

	  Should change the temp directory name to use a static int
	  rather than the socket number, and make sure log_init *is*
	  called for every proxy, not just once per client.

	* Bugzilla #9
	  No configuration option to make dircproxy to bind to certain
	  interface.

	  There should be a configuration option to make dircproxy
	  to bind to only certain interface. Right now, only port is
	  setable and dircproxy listens for clientconnections on *all*
	  available interfaces.

	  Also via e-mail:
	  Andreas Oberritter <andreas@oberritter.de>

	* Look at DCC Resume patch:
	  www-ec.njit.edu/~rxt1077/dircproxy-resume

	  ryan tolboom cis stnt <rxt1077@oak.njit.edu>

	* Apply Alexander's patch or ideas for outgoing private logging
	* Seperate private messages into private_log_file
	* Better DCC debug?

	* Debian package should have a debconf frontend asking if they
	  want a global dircproxy or just user ones.  (Could suggest a
	  fake-identd daemon).

dircproxy is being maintained, however it pretty well does everything
it's supposed to do.

Some common requests (and their reasons for not including them) are:

DCC RESUME support: This is implemented wrong by all IRC clients, which
makes is tricky to catch.  It's also goes through dircproxy after it has
already begun the transfer.  If somebody can figure this out, I will
accept a third-party patch for it.

WinNT/Win2000 support: This will never be supported.  If you can compile
and run it there, go ahead, but I won't support it.  Get a real
operating system(tm) :o)

Scripting support: dircproxy is intended as purely a bouncer, scripting
support is just making it much too much like a bot.  If you want the
kind of things bots can do, get one of those and get yourself K-Lined.

Auto-Op/Auto-Voice support: see above.  There is a user-supplied patch
which adds this at <http://www.shad0w.org.uk/code/>.  It's not official
so your mileage may vary.

Automatic connection to server: I never wrote dircproxy to do this, so
to implement the ability for it to connect without having seen a client
would be a large rewrite.  Maybe one day, not today.
