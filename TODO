Ideas for version 0.9.0:

        * /DIRCPROXY STATUS (see who's online etc),
	  /DIRCPROXY DISCONNECT (disconnect someone) and
	  /DIRCPROXY KILL (politely ask someone to leave :) for admins.

	* Change the away message every hour to indicate how long they've
	  been away

	* dircproxy to send a number of ctcp's to the client on first
	  connection, then use those as replies when the client is detached.

	  ctcp_replies no      - don't reply to any ctcp's (current)
	  ctcp_replies yes     - reply to ctcp's using dircproxy info (default)
	  ctcp_replies client  - ask first client for its replies and use them

	* Ping the client every now and then in case the server doesn't.  To
	  make sure the line hasn't dropped between the two.

	* A very simple method of automatically opping people and voicing
	  people on channels you are on.

	    auto_op "#lush,#gayteensex T-Shirt*!*scott@project.linux.com"
	    auto_op "*!aaron@*.ntl.com"

	    # first matching voice/op takes priority
	    auto_voice "#demon pbook!*"
	    auto_op "#demon *"

Ideas for the future:

	* Fake ident daemon.  Someone else will probably need to write
	  this if they want it.

	* mIRC DCC RESUME support.  This will probably happen once I'm sure
	  dircproxy supports the major UNIX IRC client DCC weirdisms.  Then
	  I'll move on to checking any mIRC DCC weirdisms like RESUME (unless
	  its already in another client I have the source for :)

	* XDCC proxy support, once I learn how it works (see above).

	* mIRC like File server.  This could tie in with XDCC support to
	  provide a dircproxy fserver/xdcc server.

	* dircproxy party line(s), to talk to whoever is online at the
	  time.
