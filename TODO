dircproxy is being maintained, however it pretty well does everything
it's supposed to do.

Some common requests (and their reasons for not including them) are:

DCC RESUME support: This is implemented wrong by all IRC clients, which
makes is tricky to catch.  It's also goes through dircproxy after it has
already begun the transfer.

WinNT/Win2000 support: This will never be supported.  If you can compile
and run it there, go ahead, but I won't support it.  Get a real
operating system(tm) :o)

Scripting support: dircproxy is intended as purely a bouncer, scripting
support is just making it much too much like a bot.  If you want the
kind of things bots can do, get one of those and get yourself K-Lined.

Auto-Op/Auto-Voice support: see above.  There is a user-supplied patch
which adds this at <http://www.shad0w.org.uk/code/>.  It's not official
so your mileage may vary.

Some outstanding things to be implemented are:

SO_KEEPALIVE option on sockets, in replacment of stoned server checking.

Display ERROR messages on first login.
