Need to do

	* the /DIRCPROXY command. (0.7.0 ?)
	  RECALL <chan/nick/*> from nlines
	  DETACH <away-msg>
	  QUIT <msg>		(change /DQUIT to this)


Would be nice

	* when -I is used, it won't close the socket, because it is waiting
	  for a client to reconnect.  Either enter listen mode somehow, or
	  disconnect everything.

	* How can we change the username being presented?  Team up with an
	  identd perhaps, or we could fork(), close all the other sockets and
	  become a one-proxy program relistening (see above).

	* (further to above to)
	  -dircproxy- Reconnect to this session at hostname.domain.tld:46702
          Maybe only if /DIRCPROXY PERSIST is sent ... ? :o)
