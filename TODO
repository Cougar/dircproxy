TODO:

	* Bug 5
	* Bug 6: Should change it to a static member and make sure that
	  log_init is called for every proxy, not just once per client
	* Apply Alexander's patch or ideas for outgoing private logging
	* Seperate private messages into private_log_file
	* Better DCC debug?

dircproxy is being maintained, however it pretty well does everything
it's supposed to do.

Some common requests (and their reasons for not including them) are:

DCC RESUME support: This is implemented wrong by all IRC clients, which
makes is tricky to catch.  It's also goes through dircproxy after it has
already begun the transfer.  If somebody can figure this out, I will
accept a third-party patch for it.

WinNT/Win2000 support: This will never be supported.  If you can compile
and run it there, go ahead, but I won't support it.  Get a real
operating system(tm) :o)

Scripting support: dircproxy is intended as purely a bouncer, scripting
support is just making it much too much like a bot.  If you want the
kind of things bots can do, get one of those and get yourself K-Lined.

Auto-Op/Auto-Voice support: see above.  There is a user-supplied patch
which adds this at <http://www.shad0w.org.uk/code/>.  It's not official
so your mileage may vary.

Automatic connection to server: I never wrote dircproxy to do this, so
to implement the ability for it to connect without having seen a client
would be a large rewrite.  Maybe one day, not today.
