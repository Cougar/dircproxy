For the next release (0.7.0)

	* the /DIRCPROXY command.
	  RECALL <chan/msg> [from] nlines
	  DETACH <away-msg>
          PERSIST
	  QUIT <msg>		(change /DQUIT to this)

	* Function to make a new listening socket, delete all other proxy
	  configs, set dedicated_proxy to 1 and announce port.

	* If dedicated_proxy = 1 then announce port on DETACH

	* PERSIST is available if die_on_close is 1, runs above function
	  and sets die_on_close to 0

	* using above, a debug() function to replace all the others lying
	  around.  Outputs to stderr if debug mode.

	  debug(level, msg, ...)

	* new syscall_fail() function, outputs to stderr if not in background
	  or in debug

	* Reload configuration file on a HUP

	* Many config options we be able to go in the connection { } class
	  to aid per-user configuration.

	* Rewrite irc_log.c to make it a little less primitive.

	  irclog_channel_msg(p, chan, from, msg, ...)
	  irclog_channel_notice(p, chan, msg, ...)
	  irclog_channel_info(p, chan, msg, ...)
	  irclog_private_msg(p, from, msg, ...)
	  irclog_notice(p, msg, ...)
	  irclog_notice_all(p, msg, ...)

	* Log configuration options to make it very cool

	  log_chan_while_online		1/0
	  keep_chan_logs		1/0

	  log_msg_while_online		1/0
	  keep_msg_logs			1/0
	  
	  chan_log_max_size		lines
	  chan_log_default_recall	lines
	  msg_log_max_size		lines
	  msg_log_default_recall	lines

	* When a user comes in and is already connected, disconnect the
	  existing user?

	  disconnect_existing_user	1/0

	* Drop modes when detached

	  drop_modes			"+o"

	* Locate mysterious "+iw" channel bug.


Whenever time permits:

	* DCC proxying/rewriting

	* DCC-via-ssh


Would be nice:

	* How can we change the username being presented?  Team up with an
	  identd perhaps, or we could fork(), setuid() and then run the
	  function to make new listening socket.
