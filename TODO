Need to do

	* the /DIRCPROXY command. (0.7.0)
	  RECALL <chan/nick/*> from nlines
	  DETACH <away-msg>
          PERSIST
	  QUIT <msg>		(change /DQUIT to this)

	* global variable saying whether we went into the background or not

	* using above, a debug() function to replace all the others lying
	  around.  neaten it up, so if in background it uses syslog, and if
	  not stderr

	* the PERSIST command will set die_on_close to 0, and create a
	  listen socket on a random port.
	  -dircproxy- Reconnect to this session at hostname.domain.tld:46702


Would be nice:

	* How can we change the username being presented?  Team up with an
	  identd perhaps, or we could fork(), close all the other sockets and
	  become a one-proxy program relistening (see above).
