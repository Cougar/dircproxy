Need to do

	* Investigate why the 'misc' log is dissapearing

	* Think better how to do PRIVMSGs/NOTICEs from people that you missed
	  perhaps one per person...

	* Maybe make misc/privmsg log remember nlines when we disconnected
	  and only spool what was missed.
	  (Channels are slightly different as we can SEE what we sent).

	* put stats into motd about size of log files and channels joined etc

	* the /DIRCPROXY command.
	  RECALL <chan/nick/*> from nlines
	  DETACH <away-msg>
	  QUIT <msg>		(change /DQUIT to this)

	* config file
	  (0.6.0)

	* Perhaps more permanent logging for those people that want it
	  (from x-trem@gmx.net)

	* Re-isolate certain "Connecting to server..." notices back to
	  being from "dircproxy" and not the server...  It seems to be
	  confusing ircII

	* Need to respond to Anti-JOIN messages if the client isn't connected
	  by deleting the channel from our lists.  (Otherwise it'll get
	  confused if when rejoining a server it can't rejoin the channel).
	  Perhaps notify user we couldn't rejoin ?

	* Change ALRM signal to TERM signal, so a normal KILL will
	  free the log files.


Would be nice

	* proper debug output and output errors to syslog

	* when -I is used, it won't close the socket, because it is waiting
	  for a client to reconnect.  Either enter listen mode somehow, or
	  disconnect everything.

	* How can we change the username being presented?  Team up with an
	  identd perhaps, or we could fork(), close all the other sockets and
	  become a one-proxy program relistening (see above).

	* (further to above to)
	  -dircproxy- Reconnect to this session at hostname.domain.tld:46702

	* -p PASSWORD [ -s SERVER ]... [ -H HOST ] [ -m MASK ]...
  	  --password=  --server=  --bind-host=  --from-mask=
	  specifies the only connection class that can be used.  There must
	  be one -s parameter of course.  Automatically turns off reading
	  connection classes from the config file

	* -f CONFIGFILE, --config-file=CONFIGFILE
	  specifies an alternate config file (otherwise ~/.dircproxyrc)

	* -P PORT, --listen-port=PORT
	  config file override

	* --rejoin-after-kick=VALUE --server-retry=VALUE
	    --server-dns-retry=VALUE --server-max-attempts=VALUE
	    --server-max-init-attempts=VALUE --detach-away-message=VALUE
	  config file overrides

	* --server-retry=VALUES
	  config
	  time between server retries
