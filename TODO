Known Bugs:

   *	Strips any character <= 32 from strings and treats as whitespace.
	This not only strips things like ^B (bold) and ^A (ctcp) but also
	strips any > 127 character because it does it using char.

   *	The removal of lines from the start of a log file results in the
   	file being unlinked, yet the new file isn't chmod()d like the old
	one was.

   *	Investigate server_pingtimeout bug on IRCnet that's been reported.

   *	Have a look to see if we can't make sure that DCC malloc()s are at
   	least trapped.  And maybe some others in the code as well.  Those
	core dumps just aren't pleasant.

   *	Can't capture DCCs when no client because of that getsockname() call
