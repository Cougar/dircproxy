0.99.x are the final testing releases before 1.0.0.  No new features
will be added unless they are considered "essential", in effect, 0.99.x
is a "frozen" branch with a 1.0.0 release being made once everyone seems
happy with it and there are no bugs.

New features will be considered once dircproxy acheives 1.0 and stability.
