Stuff to do/fix in 0.7.x:

	* Nothing yet


Stuff for 0.8.0:

	* DCC proxying/rewriting.  Not entirely sure what this involves,
	  probably having listening sockets, rewriting addresses and all
	  sorts of things like that.  Ick.

	* DCC-via-ssh.  This is quite nice, when we get a dcc request,
	  we somehow run an ssh tunnel and forward the necessary ports
	  via ssh.  Would involve killing the process when the proxy
	  has died.  A nice feature to have if possible.

	* Possible "user" directive if dircproxy is running as root, which
	  apon authentication would fork(), setuid() then dedicate the proxy
	  to that user.  This would get around some of the ident issues...

	* Support for identd's that can change username presented.
