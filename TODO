Roadmap Post-1.2.0
==================

  1.2.x - fixe bug, listen user complain, add small feature (2005-2006)
  
  
  1.3.x - (need a little explaination)  (2006-) 
  dircproxy is, hum, a large chunk of cryptic C code, with no dependency
  but full of file/hack that doesn't do a thing about IRC. 
  
     * Move all the IRC stuff in a separate lib, we have already a very good
       C irc stuff handler, both server side, and client side. 
       This should clean the main dircproxy source code
       
     * The main core of dircproxy should be more clean (not to deal with a
       lot of detail (config file, log format, irc, etc.. )
     
     * A new config file ! work in cfgfile.c is a painfull 
       Support /get /set command to modify option on the fly
       
     * Support new log format native (text) but also sql (sqlite/mysql), this
       will open the door for : 
       /DIRCPROXY RECALL channel="#dircproxy" AND msg LIKE "*version*" 
       Also a small web interface can be coded
      
     *  Rewrite it in VB dot net (just kidding)
       
    1.4.x 
     * Take over the word
