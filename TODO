For the next release (0.7.0)

	* the /DIRCPROXY command.
	  RECALL <chan/msg> from nlines
	  DETACH <away-msg>
          PERSIST
	  QUIT <msg>		(change /DQUIT to this)

	* global variable saying whether we went into the background or not

	* using above, a debug() function to replace all the others lying
	  around.  neaten it up, so if in background it uses syslog, and if
	  not stderr

	* the PERSIST command will set die_on_close to 0, and create a
	  listen socket on a random port.
	  -dircproxy- Reconnect to this session at hostname.domain.tld:46702

	* New, improved, binary log files.  (Okay so they won't be human
	  readable, but the current ones aren't really anyway!)

	  [ magic ] [ version ] [ num msgs ] { [ msgsz ] [ msg... ] }...

	  Should be relatively easy to rotate these and have maximum log file
	  sizes and things.
	
	* Configuration:
	     log_max_chan_size     } maximum number of messages
	     log_max_msg_size      } in log files

	     log_chan_while_online } log messages while online
	     log_msg_while_online  } (always logs while offline)

             log_chan_autorecall   } how many messages to recall
	     log_msg_autorecall    } when reconnecting

	* Re-read configuration file on HUP

	* Disconnection and stuff when someone else comes in
	     disconnect_existing_user 1

	  Must note that this should NOT be used with auto-reconnect
	  clients! :o)

	* Drop modes when disconnecting

	  drop_modes "+o"

	* Passwords to be encrypted in the config file!
	  maybe have a 'encrypted_password 0' option for those who don't like
	  this


Whenever time permits:


Would be nice:

	* How can we change the username being presented?  Team up with an
	  identd perhaps, or we could fork(), close all the other sockets and
	  become a one-proxy program relistening (see above).
