Need to do

	* Misc log is dissapearing because we reopen it every client connection
	  This is okay, just need to neaten it a bit, I reckon this log should
	  be for server events, and wiped every time its recalled.  PRIVMSG's
	  we'll somehow put in their own logs, and maybe only spool what you
	  missed also?

	* Perhaps more permanent logging for those people that want it
	  (from x-trem@gmx.net)
	  [ i'm thinking this is up to the client though ... ]

	* put stats into motd about size of log files and channels joined etc

	* the /DIRCPROXY command. (0.7.0 ?)
	  RECALL <chan/nick/*> from nlines
	  DETACH <away-msg>
	  QUIT <msg>		(change /DQUIT to this)

	* Re-isolate certain "Connecting to server..." notices back to
	  being from "dircproxy" and not the server...  It seems to be
	  confusing ircII

	* Need to respond to Anti-JOIN messages if the client isn't connected
	  by deleting the channel from our lists.  (Otherwise it'll get
	  confused if when rejoining a server it can't rejoin the channel).
	  Perhaps notify user we couldn't rejoin ?


Would be nice

	* when -I is used, it won't close the socket, because it is waiting
	  for a client to reconnect.  Either enter listen mode somehow, or
	  disconnect everything.

	* How can we change the username being presented?  Team up with an
	  identd perhaps, or we could fork(), close all the other sockets and
	  become a one-proxy program relistening (see above).

	* (further to above to)
	  -dircproxy- Reconnect to this session at hostname.domain.tld:46702
