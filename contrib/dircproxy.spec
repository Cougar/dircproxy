%description
dircproxy is an IRC proxy server designed for people who use IRC from lots of
different workstations or clients, but wish to remain connected and see what
they missed while they were away. You connect to IRC through dircproxy, and it
keeps you connected to the server, even after you detach your client from it.
While you're detached, it logs channel and private messages as well as
important events, and when you reattach it'll let you know what you missed.
