NEWS about changes for existing users.
--------------------------------------

Version 0.6.2 - Mon Jun 26 16:58:00 BST 2000

	* Changed the logic behind how configuration files are loaded.
	  If you supply one with -f, that is loaded.  If you don't it
	  first tries ~/.dircproxyrc and then tries etc/dircproxy.conf.
	  This means that the config file is no longer installed, and
	  can be found as dircproxy.conf in share/dircproxy or the conf
	  dir of the source.  Also the -G option is no longer valid.

Version 0.6.1 - Thu May 25 15:04:00 BST 2000

	* Just bug fixes.  No changes to worry about.

Version 0.6.0 - Wed May 24 22:33:00 BST 2000

	* There is now a configuration file.  Copy the dircproxyrc.example
	  from the conf directory to your home directory and call it
	  .dircproxyrc - this file contains all the documentation for
	  configuring dircproxy.

Version 0.5.3 - Sat May 13 16:32:00 BST 2000

	* Many of the TODO_CFG_* options defined in dircproxy.h have now
	  been given documentation and renamed.  You'll need to recheck this
	  file if you've changed them.  The PASS/SERVER/BIND ones are still
	  at the bottom and still the same however.

Version 0.5.2 - Fri May 12 23:00:00 BST 2000

	* Initial public release
