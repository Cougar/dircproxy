Version 0.6.1 - Thu May 25 15:04:00 BST 2000

	* Just bug fixes.  No changes to worry about.

Version 0.6.0 - Wed May 24 22:33:00 BST 2000

	* There is now a configuration file.  Copy the dircproxyrc.example
	  from the conf directory to your home directory and call it
	  .dircproxyrc - this file contains all the documentation for
	  configuring dircproxy.

Version 0.5.3 - Sat May 13 16:32:00 BST 2000

	* Many of the TODO_CFG_* options defined in dircproxy.h have now
	  been given documentation and renamed.  You'll need to recheck this
	  file if you've changed them.  The PASS/SERVER/BIND ones are still
	  at the bottom and still the same however.

Version 0.5.2 - Fri May 12 23:00:00 BST 2000
