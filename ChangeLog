	* configure.in, src/dns.c, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_log.c,
	src/irc_net.c, src/irc_prot.c, src/irc_server.c, src/irc_string.c,
	src/match.c, src/sprintf.c, src/sprintf.h, src/timers.c: Using
	strdup() isn't entirely portably apparently, and also it pisses off
	memdebug.c something chronic.  Check for it in configure.in, and
	use it as x_strdup() everwhere.  If it does exist, x_strdup() is
	just a wrapper for strdup(), if it doesn't exist, or DEBUG_MEMORY
        is defined, then it does its own malloc/strcpy.

	* src/: dircproxy.h, irc_client.c, irc_prot.c, irc_server.c,
	main.c: Made some of the TODO_CFG macros into the proper macros
	they will be as the defaults for the config file.  Gave them
	documentation too.
	Also added two FALLBACK defines for those things not in the config
        file that I/users might want to change

2000-05-13 04:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/.cvsignore: Added the name of the executable to the ignore
        file

2000-05-13 04:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: fchmod() doesn't take a FILE *, grrr.
	Changed to just chmod() the filename, seeing as we have that anyway

2000-05-13 04:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dns.c, irc_client.c, irc_log.c, irc_net.c, irc_prot.c,
	irc_server.c, irc_string.c, match.c, timers.c: Decided to embrace
	the fruit that is strdup() and in the process cleaned up a lot of
        code (yay!)

2000-05-13 04:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Heh, anyone on the machine could not only see what
	channels you were on, not only read everything on those channels,
	they could also read your private messages.
        This isn't good.  Made the dir be created 0700 and files 0600 now.

2000-05-13 04:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Set bind to 0 after strdup(), heh

2000-05-13 04:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Fixed a missing bracket problem that crept in
        and prevented compilation...  doh! damned "TODO" code

2000-05-13 04:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/sock.c: Made the calls to set/unset non blocking a bit more
	friendly.  Also we now block when doing a send() otherwise we loose
        data (doh!)

2000-05-13 02:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: PACKAGE and VERSION will always be defined in
	config.h unless something has really gone wrong, and that'll need
	fixing anyway.	Define them in the elsif to save code and make
        things look neeter.

2000-05-13 02:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README, src/main.c: Changed the homepage and bug reporting
        locations now we're all fully sourceforge'd up

2000-05-13 02:28  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version is 0.5.3

2000-05-13 02:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* .cvsignore, FILES.autoconf, src/.cvsignore: Removed the
	FILES.autoconf file, and replaced it with a .cvsignore in each
	directory.  This means that 'cvs update' etc will ignore any files
	generated by auto{conf,make}.  This is a good-thing.  Means you can
	run autogen.sh on your checked out version without it getting in
        the way of CVS.
