	* Adding Nickserv support (on rattach)
	
2003-11-26 21:12  Francois Harvey <fharvey@securiweb.net>
 	* irc_net.c:  you can now also enter the ip-address of the adapter 
	you want dircproxy to bind to. 
	(Patch from Folkert van Heusden <folkert@vanheusden.com>)
        
2003-11-25 21:45  Mike Taylor <bear@code-bear.com>

	* irc_log.c: fixed what appear to be simple typos

2002-08-17 21:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/dircproxy.spec, src/irc_server.c: Elminiate code
	references to sourceforge

2002-08-17 21:46  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* INSTALL: AIX and better Solaris descriptions

2002-08-17 21:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README, doc/dircproxy.1: Documentation updates

2002-08-17 21:22  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Keep the original nickname (without <>s, []s or
	--s) strip off anything after the ! and make sure the log filename
	is lowercase.

2002-08-17 21:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Newer, leaner config file

2002-08-17 21:06  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Logging of a user's copy or to a program is done
	universally now, with the advantage that privmsgs are logged by
	nickname

2002-08-17 21:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, irc_client.c, irc_net.c, irc_net.h, dircproxy.h:
	Rename the other_log_* variables to server_log, remove _copydir and
	_program in favour of new log_dir and log_program variables

2002-08-17 19:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.ac: Ok, this will be dircproxy 1.1.0, a series of bug
	fixes and new features until 1.2.0

2002-08-17 19:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, dircproxy.h, irc_log.c, irc_net.h: Collapsed the
	three *_log_timestamp and *_log_relativetime options into a single
	log_timestamp and log_relativetime option.  I can't see any reason
	why these would be customised seperately, and I need to make the
	log config file easier!

2002-08-17 19:40  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/help.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_log.c,
	src/irc_log.h, src/irc_net.c, src/irc_net.h, src/irc_server.c:
	Merged the code to seperate the private message log into a
	different file.

2002-08-17 19:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_server.c: Generate rejmsg without the end
	bit, putting that on in the function that actually sends it

2002-08-17 19:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_chat.c, dcc_send.c: Call the notify function if
	connection fails

2002-08-17 19:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_net.c, dcc_net.h: The notify function takes an extra
	parameter now, the reason for the failure

2002-08-17 19:24  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Restored missing \001 off client rejmsg

2002-08-17 17:49  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Handle config reloading in the main loop as well,
	with the signal handler just setting a variable

2002-08-17 17:46  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* autogen.sh, configure.ac: Use the AM_MAINTAINER_MODE flag so
	there aren't any surprises

2002-08-17 17:35  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Instead of waiting on children and handling DNS
	results in the CHLD signal handler, simply catch it (so it
	interrupts whatever we're doing).  Then in the main loop, we always
	wait on any children - that way we don't do anything exotic like
	malloc() in the signal handler, which will hopefully appease
	FreeBSD which has a bit of a problem with that.

2002-08-14 21:15  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Fixed a typo spotted by James O'Gorman

2002-08-13 17:35  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Removed TODO file

2002-08-13 17:31  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Applied modified version of Alexander Dohmen
	<alex@netcase.nl>'s patch to log outgoing private messages

2002-08-13 17:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* .cvsignore, RELEASING, acconfig.h, autogen.sh, configure.ac,
	configure.in: Updated to newer automake and autoconf

2002-08-13 16:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ: Expand stuff a bit more, moving things out of TODO which I
	doubt people'll read.

2002-08-13 16:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ: Document why we don't do RESUME in the FAQ

2002-08-13 14:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Use a static int counter to make the log
	directories unique, rather than the socket number, which was a bit
	evil hackwise.

2002-08-04 13:31  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: TODO for the package

2002-08-04 13:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

2002-07-14 09:53  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Handle CHLD signals portably by reaping any that
	arrive (as we care about getting all of them)

2002-04-25 22:57  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Once again, things to do

	commands

2002-02-06 10:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Write pid file on startup and unlink on close.  This
	is specified by the 'pid_file' config directive or the new -p
	command line parameter

2002-02-06 10:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, cfgfile.h, dircproxy.h, irc_net.h: Added config

2002-02-06 10:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/: Makefile.am, README, cronchk.sh: Added the
	much-asked-for crontab checking script, and a spot of documentation
	about what all these things are.

2002-02-05 10:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ: Added a few more FAQs

2002-02-05 10:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	script to log private messages to seperate files (fixes a FAQ)

2002-02-05 10:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1: Documented that nick_keep
	generally only works while you DON'T connect a client

2002-02-05 09:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Not going to do automatic connection to server

2002-02-05 09:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Only run the client_resetnick timer if
	nick_keep is set in the configuration file

2002-01-31 14:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

2002-01-31 13:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c, src/irc_net.h,
	src/irc_server.c: Log topic changes too

2002-01-28 04:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: That bad patch has left a haunting bug ever since
	0.8.0 that I only spotted by reading the source for some random
	reason.
	
	If the config file couldn't be re-read, the global variables (all 3
	of them) would be reset to their default values, because the
	memcpy() had been duplicated inside the failure if {}

2002-01-27 23:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ, README: Changed URLs to dircproxy.net now, yay

2002-01-24 01:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Resend the detach message to each channel we
	rejoin when the server gets disconnected while the client is
	detached.

2001-07-12 14:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.c: If malloc()s fail within the majority of the socket
	handler, it shouldn't crash anymore, just return bad flags

2001-07-12 14:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: When rotating log files, keep the permissions as
	0600.

2001-07-12 14:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_log.c: Only strip those characters from
	the end we really want to treat as whitespace.	Doing otherwise
	strips high characters and control characters

2001-07-12 14:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Only do the getsockname() call if the client is
	active, otherwise it'll fail.  We cope with not having a client if
	it is supposed to have succeeeded anyway.

2001-05-07 17:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, README, TODO: Version 1.0.0 released.

2001-01-11 15:14  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, configure.in, contrib/dircproxy.spec: CVS version now
	1.0.0

2000-12-27 18:28  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ, README: Included IRC channel in the documentation

2000-12-27 18:04  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.c: Wasn't handling read events if the socket was marked
	as closed, this includes error events obviously.  This could cause
	100% CPU usage if there's data waiting to be written on the socket.
	 Instead just make sure we don't call the error_func if socket is
	closed (it'd get confused).

2000-12-27 17:50  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ: Added the most FAQ to the FAQ :)

2000-12-26 18:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in, contrib/dircproxy.spec: CVS version now 0.99.1

2000-12-26 18:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Version 0.99.0 released.

2000-12-26 17:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, configure.in: CVS version now 0.99.0, time to freeze it.

2000-12-26 17:33  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Fixed it so it only replies when the client
	isn't connected (oops)

2000-12-26 17:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.h, src/irc_server.c:
	Added support for CTCP replies while the client is detached.

2000-12-26 16:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.c, irc_server.c, irc_server.h,
	main.c: Completely replaced ircserver_send_command() with
	ircserver_send_peercmd() as we never really should prefix stuff.

2000-12-22 13:24  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_net.c: Do a connect() before a listen() so that they've
	both got a chance of binding to the same port.

2000-12-21 13:27  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_client.h, src/irc_net.c,
	src/irc_server.c, src/irc_string.h: * Changed the way all the NICK
	code works, so it keeps it inline with what   the client AND server
	think the nick is.
	
	* Use peercmd everywhere now, its safer
	
	* Adjusted the detach autowash order, so it works properly without
	errors
	
	* Use new net_close syntax everywhere
	
	* New dcc stuff

2000-12-21 13:24  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_net.c, dcc_net.h: Added notification to dcc's, so if
	they timeout we can send a NOTICE back to the user who initiated
	it.
	
	* Also bind the outgoing connect port, it doesn't matter if this
	doesn't   work (like if there's only one port available) but if it
	does work it'll   help people behind firewalls.
	
	* Updated to use new net_close syntax

2000-12-21 13:22  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_chat.c, dcc_send.c: Updated to new net_close syntax

2000-12-21 13:21  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: net.c, net.h: Made net_close explicitly set the socket to
	-1 (changed to take a pointer) and also made sure no read events
	occur if the socket is already closed

2000-12-21 13:21  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_net.h: Added new 'nick_keep' configuration
	option and the associated variables etc.

2000-12-11 21:50  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Updated

2000-12-10 14:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/Makefile.am: Oops, inadvertently set the spec file to be
	installed into the share directory, when it shouldn't get installed
	at all.

2000-12-10 03:06  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RELEASING, TODO, contrib/Makefile.am, contrib/dircproxy.spec:
	Added dircproxy.spec provided by Hollis R Blanchard
	<hollis+@andrew.cmu.edu>

2000-12-08 14:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RELEASING: Another new step in releasing dircproxy, e-mail
	nidd@debian.org to inform him of any changes that could affect his
	debian package.  I need a secretary *laughs* :o)

2000-12-07 18:27  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Lowercase the filename used for log files

2000-12-07 18:06  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RELEASING: Updated slightly

2000-12-07 18:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.8.5

2000-12-07 17:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, TODO: Version 0.8.4 released.

2000-12-07 17:21  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_send.c: Got rid of the extraneous debug stuff that's not
	actually needed

2000-12-07 17:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_send.c: Large rework of DCC Send proxying.  We now store
	everything we get from the sender in an internal buffer until we
	can send it out to the sendee.	This means the sender can
	disconnect part way through without the whole lot going *splegh*
	all over the place.

2000-12-07 17:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: New #define variable - DCC_BLOCK_SIZE, the
	maximum size of a block to send while doing dcc proxying.  Its not
	a config file parameter because the logic behind it isn't exactly
	spock-like.  Basically, it'll only be used when there is LOTS of
	data in the buffer.  If the sendee connects before the sender then
	it won't be used at all because the data will hopefully be ack'd
	fast enough to not care.

2000-12-07 17:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_net.h: Need to now know how much data total we've
	received from the sender (bytes_recvd) [should always be bytes_sent
	+ bufsz, but I ain't risking using that in case i fuck up], need a
	buffer and a variable to tell us how big it is, and a new status
	for dcc sender socket's (DCC_SENDER_GONE)

2000-12-07 17:01  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_net.c: Adjusted the logic of the timer code now, as it
	isn't quite as clear cut as "are they both connected"?
	
	* Made sure all sockets are set to -1 after being closed, just in
	case the sender leaves, and the client connects just after and gets
	the same socket number (and confuses the living buggery out of us).
	
	* Free the buffer when freeing the proxy

2000-12-07 16:59  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_chat.c, irc_client.c, irc_server.c: Just to be on the
	safe side, set any socket to -1 after closing it.  Otherwise
	there's a *slight* possibility that we could accidentally mistake
	it for another (especially with the dcc code).

2000-12-07 16:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RELEASING: Updated release procedures.

2000-12-06 15:25  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: Added initial_modes stuf

2000-12-06 15:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_net.c, irc_net.h: Added initial_modes variable

2000-12-06 15:15  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: if JUMP is done without paramters, pick the
	next server in the list.
	
	* Always match IP address as well as hostname with 'from'
	
	* Set initial_modes on first authentication

2000-12-06 15:10  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/help.h: Added new JUMP syntax

2000-12-06 15:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/cfgfile.c: Added initial_modes config option and at the same
	time made all non-fatal errors have a (warning) prefix

2000-12-06 15:06  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1: New initial_modes config
	option added

2000-12-05 16:20  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Updated

2000-12-04 12:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Its possible that ircserver_close_sock can be
	called without a connection class, so always delete the timers

2000-12-03 21:44  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Changed message to be less confusing

2000-12-03 19:25  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More stuff to do

2000-11-30 12:57  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Updated to reflect whats gonna be happening

2000-11-28 15:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_net.c: Wasn't setting the DCC_SENDEE_LISTENING flag, so
	if they never connect to us, then we never close the listening
	socket.

2000-11-28 12:14  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_net.c, irc_net.c: Dunno why I was using %p in debug()
	messages - that uses my internal format stuff which ignores them.

2000-11-28 12:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.c: If poll() or select() was interrupted, or replied that
	there were no events, then for efficiency reasons I didn't go into
	the loop and read/write from the sockets.  However, this mean't
	that until something happened, the activity function wouldn't get
	called if there was data queued internally for the socket.  This
	affected things like DCCs and made them stalled.
	
	Always do this loop now.

2000-11-24 14:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.8.4.

2000-11-24 13:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Version 0.8.3 released.

2000-11-24 13:44  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.c, irc_net.h, irc_server.c: Grab a
	hostname from the one we lookup until we get something better.
	
	Accept any number of PASS/NICK/USER in any variation until we have
	all three *then* authenticate them.  This mean't restructuring the
	login sequence a bit - but it means its a lot more server-like now
	and actually probably a bit easier to figure out new things with.
	
	Fixed the nickname desync problems by always using change_nick
	everywhere and forcing a NICK command back to the user if we get a
	433 or something similar.  Also instead of "forgetting" the
	nickname when its juped during server reconnect while client
	connected - we keep it, but simply ask for a new one.  That way we
	can generate the required back NICK command.
	
	QUIT's and NICK's are only logged to the private message log - not
	all of them!
	
	Made sure connection loss while not online is logged.

2000-11-23 12:33  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.8.3.

2000-11-23 12:19  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Version 0.8.2 released.

2000-11-21 13:50  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README.dcc-via-ssh: Bit of clarification on when you actually
	need the tunnels

2000-11-21 13:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* INSTALL: Further instructions on MacOS X compile (thanks BillyH
	btw!)

2000-11-21 13:35  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* INSTALL: It works on a Mac too!

2000-11-20 15:25  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_chat.c, dcc_send.c, irc_client.c, irc_server.c: If we
	ever get an unexpected socket, then close it.

2000-11-20 12:49  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* INSTALL: Updated slightly

2000-11-20 12:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.c: Slightly altered to suppress warnings on older libcs

2000-11-20 12:22  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_chat.c, dcc_send.c: Made sure we actually close dcc
	sockets and not just declare them dead.  This will hopefully cure
	the "lots of read error" problems people have been getting.

2000-11-20 11:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Somehow lost the #include for sys/types.h -
	broke compilation on FreeBSD

2000-11-15 16:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.8.2.

2000-11-15 16:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Version 0.8.1 released.

2000-11-15 16:10  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, src/dcc_net.h, src/dcc_send.c: Instead
	of mucking around with typedefs, use the uint32_t type defined by
	ISO C 9x to be in inttypes.h - we can then check for this header
	file and if it doesn't exist #define uint32_t to be unsigned long.

2000-11-15 15:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* acconfig.h: Added new typedefs to stop autoconf moaning

2000-11-15 15:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: [ Bug #122324 ] fixed configure issues on other
	platforms

2000-11-15 15:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* crypt/Makefile.am: Forgot to LDADD libgetopt.a

2000-11-15 15:32  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dns.c: Save the address being looked up if we can, then if
	the dns lookup fails we can pretend it worked because we use the
	addr they looked up and the inet_ntoa() version of it for a name. 
	This was supposed to do this, but for some reason only if
	result.success (oops)

2000-11-15 14:59  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_net.c, main.c: A few bugs relating to inetd operation. 
	Specifically I wasn't hooking the socket into the fancy new socket
	stuff I wrote, so it'd get bored and exit thinking there weren't
	any.

2000-11-14 11:49  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: [ Bug #122189 ]  Use the TEMP envvar if TMPDIR
	isn't defined.	Also make sure that p->temp_logdir isn't 0 before
	using it to generate a log filename

2000-11-10 16:28  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.8.1.

2000-11-10 15:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, README, TODO, RELEASING: Version 0.8.0 released.

2000-11-10 15:18  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Accidentally dropped an '=' in there

2000-11-10 15:14  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.h: Use signed longs for log file offsets

2000-11-10 15:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.c: Made net_poll() a little more efficient by only
	realloc()ing if the number of ufds changes

2000-11-10 15:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/memdebug.c: Left in some code so I can enable reporting of
	all malloc()s if I want it

2000-11-10 15:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Mostly general neatening

2000-11-10 15:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_string.c: Made irc_strcasecmp a little more efficient
	seeing as we use it so much

2000-11-10 15:10  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: switch_user support done through seteuid()
	
	Added code to do dcc send capturing

2000-11-10 15:09  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: _irclog_read needs to take a FILE * not a log
	file, so it will read if the log isn't open (but a file to it is).
	
	Use long's as log offsets when recalling.
	
	Removed the last of the is_chan code
	
	Freeing memory we forgot to when filtering
	
	Adjusted the relative timestamps so > 7 days you don't see a time

2000-11-10 15:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Use *signed* longs for log offsets, and
	actually detach on /QUIT so we don't wait for a socket to notice
	they've gone

2000-11-10 15:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dns.c: Added an extra pipe to avoid race conditions, also
	actually check the wait() status properly

2000-11-10 15:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, dircproxy.h, irc_net.c, irc_net.h: Added the
	dcc_capture_* options and the switch_user option

2000-11-10 15:06  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_net.c, dcc_net.h, dcc_send.c: Added dcc capture support

2000-11-10 15:04  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Added the new dcc_* and switch_user options

2000-11-10 15:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy.1: Added documentation for dcc_* options and the
	switch_user option

2000-11-10 15:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy-crypt.1: dircproxy-crypt now has command line
	options - updated the man page

2000-11-10 15:01  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ, README.inetd: Documentation updates

2000-11-10 15:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: A few more checks, and added getopt and crypt dirs

2000-11-10 15:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/log.pl: Added in docs for unfiltered ctcp

2000-11-10 14:59  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* getopt/: .cvsignore, Makefile, Makefile.in, getopt.o, getopt1.o,
	libgetopt.a: Accidentally committed binaries, removed them and
	added a .cvsignore

2000-11-10 14:57  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* crypt/: .cvsignore, Makefile, Makefile.in, dircproxy-crypt,
	main.o: Accidentally checked in the binaries (wakey, wakey!)
	Removed them and added in a .cvsignore file

2000-11-10 14:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/Makefile.am, contrib/crypt.c, src/Makefile.am,
	src/getopt.c, src/getopt.h, src/getopt1.c, Makefile.am,
	crypt/Makefile, crypt/Makefile.am, crypt/Makefile.in,
	crypt/dircproxy-crypt, crypt/main.c, crypt/main.o, getopt/Makefile,
	getopt/Makefile.am, getopt/Makefile.in, getopt/getopt.c,
	getopt/getopt.h, getopt/getopt.o, getopt/getopt1.c,
	getopt/getopt1.o, getopt/libgetopt.a: Moved the getopt files out of
	src into their own getopt directory, which gets compiled into a
	libgetopt.a we include to make dircproxy itself.
	
	Also moved the crypt.c out of contrib and into its own crypt
	directory, improved this a bit and linked it to libgetopt.a to make
	it a bit neater

2000-11-06 17:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_net.c, irc_net.h: Extra config options added and freed.
	 Ports are int not shorts

2000-11-06 17:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_server.c: DCC code modified to work a lot
	better, and be configurable and take advantage of tunnel ports and
	stuff.
	
	Debug code should be inside ''s Fixed memory leak of not freeing
	p->serverpassword Made sure that msg.src contains information for
	server code (irc client code doesn't need this)

2000-11-06 16:57  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dns.c, dns.h: Use an extra pipe to tell the child when the
	parent is able to reap it, this avoids the race condition that
	happens on really fast machines where the child exits before the
	parent's had time to realise its a dns query (therefore never
	finishes the request and hangs).
	
	Also use ints not shorts for ports!

2000-11-06 16:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_net.c, dcc_net.h: Code to do port ranges added, timeout
	code added, dcc send hooks added and p->type changed to be a mask

2000-11-06 16:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_chat.c, dcc_chat.h: Made data+error functions tatic as
	they aren't used outside of here.  Also extra warning if connection
	fails.

2000-11-06 16:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, dircproxy.h: New config file options:       
	dcc_proxy_incoming   [bool]	dcc_proxy_outgoing   [bool]    
	dcc_proxy_ports      [specially handled]	dcc_proxy_timeout  
	 [numeric]  dcc_proxy_sendreject [bool]     dcc_send_fast	
	[bool]	   dcc_tunnel_incoming	[int]	   dcc_tunnel_outgoing 
	[int]

2000-11-06 16:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: Makefile.am, dcc_send.c, dcc_send.h: Added the code to do
	both simple and fast dcc send proxying.  The dcc capture code will
	also go in here somewhere.

2000-11-06 16:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ, README.dcc-via-ssh, TODO: Documentation updates

2000-11-02 16:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Dropped the DCC code in wholesale, and it
	worked, whoo!

2000-11-02 16:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_string.c: Whoa, irc_strupr actually tolower()d things

2000-11-02 16:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_prot.c: Upper case the DCC command name according to IRC
	rules

2000-11-02 16:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Twiddling

2000-11-02 16:15  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Really cleaned this up by using msg.src.orig
	all over the place instead of trying to build it manually each
	time.  Also made sure we never use msg.src without checking its
	there, and if not always use p->servername instead.

2000-11-02 16:14  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_prot.c, irc_prot.h: Keep the original prefix so we
	don't have to rebuild it each time

2000-11-02 16:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Cleaned up CTCP handling a fair bit, making it
	less indented and more streamlined

2000-11-02 16:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_net.c: Slightly more useful debug information

2000-11-02 16:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_chat.c: Was hooking the wrong socket (erk) and also need
	to check that the other side is connected before sending the data
	to it.

2000-11-02 13:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_chat.c, dcc_chat.h, dcc_net.c: Slight tidying to give a
	bit more response to the user.

2000-11-01 17:58  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dcc_chat.c: Changed the debug direction indicators to make it
	clear this is dcc

2000-11-01 17:57  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_prot.c: Don't dequote until we actually parse the CTCP
	message.  This is so s->str can be guaranteed to be within \001's
	inside the msg.orig

2000-11-01 15:04  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: Makefile.am, main.c: Intergrated DCC chat stuff so its all
	cleaned up.  Still need to actually do it though :o)

2000-11-01 15:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dcc_chat.c, dcc_chat.h, dcc_net.c, dcc_net.h: Got a bit
	enthusiastic and wrote all the code necessary to do a dcc chat
	proxying.  Well, still a bit to do (listen_port ranges and stuff
	for example) plus it could do with being a LOT cleaner - but hey! 
	its getting there

2000-11-01 15:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.c: If net_read() is called with a len of 0 just return
	how much data is in the buffer

2000-11-01 15:01  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.c, irc_server.c, net.h: new
	_FUNCTION() macros for the net stuff, made the code use these. 
	Also cleaned up the CTCP stuff and made server work properly

2000-11-01 14:59  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_log.c, irc_log.h: CTCP logging needs to be done a
	little differently to make sure the timestamp is fully inside the
	CTCP and after the command.  New irclog_ctcp function to do this.

2000-10-31 13:11  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_log.c, src/irc_net.h,
	src/irc_prot.c, src/irc_prot.h, src/irc_server.c: time_offset
	changed to log_timeoffset because of new log_events option that
	sits quite nicely with it in the config file.  Lots more logging,
	which is done according to how log_events is set.  We also now
	strip CTCP out of messages sensibly and are able to parse and act
	on the CTCP's we get out including logging them, or logging
	ACTION's now (yay!) and even in future doing DCC stuff.
	
	Also fixed: when kicked, channel wouldn't get deleted properly,
	join option in config file didn't like ",," or ", #chan" -
	appropriate errors added

2000-10-30 13:44  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ, conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_log.c, src/irc_log.h,
	src/irc_net.c, src/irc_net.h: Quite a large change to the way
	logging code works now.  Made it a hell of a lot neater in the
	process too.  The idea is that all dircproxy logs always end up in
	/tmp, and you can use the new _log_copydir (replacing the old
	_log_dir) option to specify a place to store ALL text logged, or
	the program to do stuff with it.

2000-10-30 13:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Don't need to send a NICK command to the client
	on receipt of a bad nickname numeric, they'll respond to it anyway.

2000-10-30 13:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Prettied up the error/warning output a bit

2000-10-27 13:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Should probably set c->key to 0 after freeing it

2000-10-27 13:11  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Didn't bother to check whether p->modes was set
	or refuse_mode itself was set before doing a strcspn()...   I must
	have written THAT at 4am!

2000-10-23 12:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.c: Sockets with data to write now write that data before
	they close, and have a few seconds to write it during a shutdown as
	well.  Fixed a few bugs here as well.

2000-10-23 12:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.h: Added the net_closeall() prototype

2000-10-23 12:33  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Made sure we don't net_gets() on a closed
	socket, tested and fixed the nickname generation so its much nicer
	now, fixed up the QUIT messages to try and get more irc clients to
	show them and finally modified to use the new dns/timer syntax

2000-10-23 12:32  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Fixed KICK without a source bug, made sure we
	don't net_gets() a closed socket and modified the rest to use the
	new dns/timer syntax

2000-10-23 12:30  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Modified the use of dns and timers

2000-10-23 12:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Bit of cleanup of the stop stuff, made errors more
	obvious in debug mode and calling net_closeall()

2000-10-23 12:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/memdebug.c: Added some code to produce pretty statistics of
	which .c files are doing the most malloc()s.  Also made it so if
	file is 0 it doesn't count it (but still checks it) so I can hide
	debug() mallocs

2000-10-23 12:19  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: Added new define for net linger time

2000-10-23 12:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: timers.c, timers.h: Made it so that timers don't depend on
	a struct ircproxy, just a random void pointer

2000-10-23 12:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dns.c, dns.h: Made it so that the DNS stuff doesn't rely on
	a struct ircproxy, just any random void pointer.

2000-10-23 11:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: Allow poll() and select() to be disabled through
	configure

2000-10-23 11:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Another bug to fix :(

2000-10-23 11:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ, conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1: Lots of documentation
	improvements and documented the new dircproxy-crypt program too

2000-10-23 11:53  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/Makefile.am: Install the dircproxy man page

2000-10-23 11:53  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy-crypt.1, contrib/.cvsignore, contrib/Makefile.am:
	Made the 'crypt' program into something called 'dircproxy-crypt'
	that gets installed with dircproxy and even has a man page too!

2000-10-20 12:44  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_log.c, src/irc_net.h: Added fancy new log
	timestamping and time offset code.

2000-10-20 11:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_log.c, src/irc_net.c,
	src/irc_net.h, src/irc_server.c, src/irc_server.h, src/main.c,
	src/net.c, src/net.h: Completely moved over to new socket code now,
	so its all non-blocking and sexy.  Also throttling of server
	sockets and appropriate server_throttle configuration file option.

2000-10-20 11:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: Check for poll.h,sys/poll.h and poll() itself

2000-10-18 17:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/net.c: More static functions

2000-10-18 13:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, src/Makefile.am, src/net.c, src/net.h, src/sock.c,
	src/sock.h: Replacing sock.c/sock.h with a new net.c/net.h which is
	much more advanced, and will also do things like the poll() /
	select() loop.

2000-10-16 12:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Still need to check whether username/hostname
	are actually set, even if we're IRC_USER

2000-10-16 11:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Code to do channel keys (yay!)

2000-10-16 11:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Code to send and check MODE's for channel keys
	now added

2000-10-16 11:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Couple of bugs with the privmsg/notice code,
	including a %s%s%s vulnerability These have been fixed

2000-10-16 10:59  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Changed to use irc_strcasecmp for the commands,
	won't make any difference but its nicer

2000-10-16 10:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Changed to use irc_strcasecmp for the commands,
	won't make any difference but its nicer

2000-10-16 10:51  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Updated dircproxy persist docs

2000-10-16 10:49  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Made sure you can't /DIRCPROXY PERSIST (and
	kill off any other possible users) if die_on_close is 1 because of
	the config file.  If it is because of the config file, then just
	set die_on_close to 0 and announce that they can persist.

2000-10-16 10:46  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.h: Added header code for the new channel mode
	monitoring stuff, this means that irc_net.h will need irc_prot.h

2000-10-16 10:45  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_prot.c: Make sure that IRC_USER is only set if there's
	definitly a nickname, username and hostname

2000-10-16 10:45  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: *sigh* Updates to the TODO file

2000-10-16 10:44  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1: Added a bit of extra text to
	try to explain that you shouldn't set chan_log_dir/other_log_dir
	unless you really want that

2000-10-16 10:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/sprintf.h: Clive D.W. Feather himself came up with the
	prettiest suggestion for my sprintf() trick, so his gets to be in
	the code :)

2000-10-16 10:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/help.h: Fixed the /DIRCPROXY PERSIST documentation so its a
	little more helpful

2000-10-16 10:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* Makefile.am: Need to include the dcc-via-ssh docs with the
	distribution too

2000-10-16 10:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* Makefile.am: The FAQ goes with the distribution

2000-10-16 10:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* FAQ: Put some frequently questioned answers in

2000-10-13 17:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: sprintf.c, sprintf.h: Yay, thanks to l33t Demon staff, they
	dug out a new C99 syntax feature that GCC supports that lets you do
	variable argument macros.  Because this is debug mode I'm happy to
	put this C99 stuff in :)

2000-10-13 14:33  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* INSTALL: Got word that dircproxy 0.7.3 compiles under Windows NT
	without any modification, so added that to the list.

2000-10-13 13:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Traditional update to the TODO file

2000-10-13 13:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.c, src/irc_net.h, src/irc_server.c:
	Channels can have keys locking them, so we should do our best to
	find out what these are and remember them so we can join channels
	and provide the right key.  First step: Allowing the "join" config
	option to have keys in it '#chan key,#chan key' etc.

2000-10-13 13:50  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.c, src/irc_net.h:
	Another new config option, detach_nickname - changes your nickname
	for you when you detach

2000-10-13 13:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_server.c: Removed the server_dnsretry
	config option.	Now that we have non-blocking DNS, there's no real
	need to wait longer after a DNS retry - especially as it'll
	probably try another server anyway!

2000-10-13 13:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Oops, mucked up a sync patch somewhere

2000-10-13 13:35  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c, src/cfgfile.h,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/dns.c, src/irc_client.c, src/main.c: Instead
	of a few #define's which aren't easy to change for timeouts I've
	moved them into a new "globalvars" structure which is passed to
	cfg_read and be accessed everywhere as g.<var> - this means these
	variables can now be altered inside the config file

2000-10-13 13:27  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Improved the /DIRCPROXY HELP command so the
	command list gives a quick idea what the command does

2000-10-13 13:24  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/help.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.h: Added
	in a new /DIRCPROXY DIE command and the appropriate allow_die
	config option (no by default!)

2000-10-13 13:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Make sure the server_recon timer is deleted
	just in case they jump or quit during a reconnection phase

2000-10-13 13:15  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Better feedback during server connections

2000-10-13 13:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Included the code to actually make the new
	quit_message config actually do something

2000-10-13 13:06  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy.1: Improved the documentation a bit

2000-10-13 13:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Improved the documentation and general layout
	of dircproxyrc

2000-10-13 12:53  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: sprintf.c, sprintf.h: x_strdup() and x_sprintf() are now
	specially designed so that when DEBUG_MEMORY is enabled they talk
	to the memdebug layer directly and are able to tell you where
	x_strdup() was called instead of just the line inside x_strdup()
	that did the malloc().	Will make debugging a LOT easier.

2000-10-13 12:50  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Improved the documentation

2000-10-13 12:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Added more info to the top

2000-10-13 12:46  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Fixed up the documentation

2000-10-13 12:44  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Improved the top description

2000-10-13 12:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_prot.c: Better description at the top.

2000-10-13 12:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_string.c: Better described this

2000-10-13 12:32  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dns.c: Forgot to check whether the child returned a status of
	0 (everything ok) if it doesn't then its probably timeout or system
	failure

2000-10-13 12:31  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dns.c: Improved the top comments so they describe this file
	better now.

2000-10-13 12:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: Added prototype for new stop() function

2000-10-13 12:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Added a function that can be called to end the main
	loop

2000-10-13 12:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: More fully described what this does.

2000-10-13 12:22  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/memdebug.h: Being picky and marked the #endif with a comment

2000-10-13 12:21  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/sock.c: Fixed some comments.  If we're gonna have output
	buffers I want to not confuse them with the input buffers.

2000-10-12 16:24  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c, src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_net.c,
	src/irc_net.h: Added support for default /QUIT messages

2000-10-12 16:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: New ideas

2000-10-12 16:10  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Added support for default QUIT messages

2000-10-12 16:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Recall the other_log file *after* channels, so
	private messages appear last in the window

2000-10-12 16:04  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Non-blocking DNS done

2000-10-12 16:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.c, irc_server.c: Changes to
	accomodate the new DNS system

2000-10-12 16:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Handle DNS children in the SIGCHLD handler, and also
	clear up any DNS child processes

2000-10-12 16:01  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.h: To accomodate two-stage DNS lookups we need an
	extra server status that indicates the server is connected (so
	don't check for connection) but we haven't yet been introduced to
	it.

2000-10-12 16:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dns.c, dns.h: Almost total rewrite of the DNS code.  Now
	you have to request a DNS and provide a function to run once the
	DNS lookup is complete.  The code will then fork() off to do the
	lookup and continue with normal execution of the program.  When the
	client exits, the result is on a pipe, and once read execution is
	continued from the function you give it.
	
	(ie non-blocking DNS :o)

2000-10-12 15:59  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: Added a #define to set the DNS timeout

2000-10-11 16:33  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More things

2000-10-11 16:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README, TODO: Don't need contrib scripts, clients should just
	pass /dircproxy to us

2000-10-11 16:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Made /DIRCPROXY QUIT and DETACH just use every
	paramter joined together rather than the last one (removing the
	need for quoting!)

2000-10-11 16:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_prot.c, irc_prot.h: Also record where in the msg.orig
	string a paramter started, so we can just copy the whole lot to
	things like quit messages etc.

2000-10-11 15:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* CTCPSPEC, DCCSPEC: Added the DCC and CTCP specifications for
	reference.  Not needed in the distribution, just handy to have
	around for the CVS developer (me).

2000-10-10 13:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/help.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_log.c,
	src/irc_net.c, src/irc_net.h, src/irc_server.c, src/irc_server.h,
	src/main.c, src/timers.c: Been working on dircproxy for a week
	while on holiday, so this is gonna be a VERY big patch (only
	problem with sourceforge really, you can't take the CVS offline :(
	)
	
	New options:	server_autoconnect	channel_leave_on_detach    
	    channel_rejoin_on_attach	    refuse_modes   
	chan_log_enabled	chan_log_program	other_log_enabled  
	    other_log_program	    motd_file	    allow_jump	   
	allow_jump_new	allow_host	join (for connection class)
	
	Changed options:	Any option that accepted "none" also
	accepts ""
	
	New commands:	/DIRCPROXY SERVERS	/DIRCPROXY JUMP        
	/DIRCPROXY HOST 	/DIRCPROXY MOTD
	
	New features not mentioned:	Timeouts for client authorization
	and connection to a server    Unjoined channels (channels we are
	on, but won't join until a client	     attaches)	     Only
	does certain things for joined + active channels   Instead of
	ignoring everything (including disconnect) from clients 	   
	 until we have a server connection, we simply return a		
	RPL_TRYAGAIN for everything but the /DIRCPROXY command if	   
	    we don't have a server connection.	This means dircproxy	   
		will notice things like disconnects finally (yay!)     
	Cleaned up quit messages to make them a bit more amusing       
	Made sure ERRORs are sent for any non-user-requested client	   
	    disconnection   Cleaned up motd stuff and moved to seperate
	function etc.  Looks		    a lot nicer and works nicer now
	too.	Debug code added so you can see what dircproxy sends extra
	to that 	     which it proxies	     Spaced out irc_net.h
	into the same groups as the config file    SERVER_READY does not
	necessarily mean SERVER_SEEN (this gets set		  on a 001)
	- so if a server denies our connection we treat 	      it as
	still in the "initial" phase.	  New function to drop+restore
	server connection (treating it as		   new initial
	connection)	    Send PARTs when server connection is lost,
	JOINs are sent again		     on restoration of service (to
	prevent client from getting		  baffled).	  Made sure
	we never send stuff in timers without checking the	     
	server is ready 	Child reaping	Timer debugging
	
	Bugs fixed:	The pesky "+i No such channel" bug.. gonna fix this
	in 0.7 too

2000-10-10 12:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/log.pl: Added a nice script to demonstrate the new
	{chan,other}_log_program options that are to be added.

2000-09-29 16:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Slight bug - didn't check that idle_maxtime was
	set when resetting idle time - so it actually did this with a timer
	of 0

2000-09-29 15:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1: Added documentation for
	allow_persist, attach_message and detach_message

2000-09-29 15:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Fixed a bug - was using p not tmp_p (bad!)

2000-09-29 15:51  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, dircproxy.h, irc_client.c, irc_net.c, irc_net.h:
	Added the code to do attach_message and detach_message stuff

2000-09-29 12:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, src/cfgfile.c, src/dircproxy.h, src/help.h,
	src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.h: Changed the config file code so
	that it uses a struct ircconnclass to store the globals in rather
	than a million ickle variables - makes it much neater.
	
	Added the allow_persist option, and adjusted the help code
	accordingly to make sure that it doesn't show PERSIST in the help
	unless its on.

2000-09-28 12:32  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README, README.dcc-via-ssh, TODO: Added DCC-via-SSH
	documentation, and cleaned up the README itself.

2000-09-28 10:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More TODO updates

2000-09-28 10:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.h, irc_server.c, irc_server.h: Added
	code to prevent idling - uses a timer which is set to be
	idle_maxtime seconds after the last privmsg/notice.  Sends an empty
	PRIVMSG which generates a 411 error, so need to have a setting to
	squelch this when we've sent it.
	
	(note: doesn't use allow_411 type syntax, because its a single
	response that  we can't tell whether will be generated or not.)

2000-09-28 10:35  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, dircproxy.h: Added config code for new
	idle_maxtime option

2000-09-28 10:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1: Added config option and
	documentation for new idle_maxtime option

2000-09-28 10:33  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: Added documentation for /dircproxy command

2000-09-27 17:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: Development of 0.8 now beginning, any changes to
	0.7 will be done on a branch off 0.7.3.
	
	CVS version now 0.8.0

2000-09-27 16:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, TODO: Version 0.7.3 released.

2000-09-27 16:45  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/irc_client.c,
	src/irc_net.h, src/irc_server.c: Changed the way that stoned server
	checking works.  Instead of measuring times between PINGs from
	server, do our own PINGs and measure time between the PONGs we get
	back.

2000-09-27 16:11  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/memdebug.c: Heh, that pesky memory leak turned out to be in
	memdebug.c itself, forgot to free ms->file

2000-09-27 12:11  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More stuff

2000-09-26 15:10  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Spaced out a bit more for legibility

2000-09-26 15:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More stuff for 0.8 - its gonna be a big release

2000-09-26 13:24  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RFC1413: Added the ident RFC, because 0.8 will have its own
	miniature identd daemon with it.

2000-09-26 12:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: TODO changes

2000-09-26 11:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Forced QUITs (as apposed to user quits) generate
	different error messages

2000-09-26 11:51  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.c, irc_server.c: Added a few more
	QUIT messages, to make sure we never leave the server with "EOF
	from client" if we can help it.  Each message is *slightly*
	different to aid debugging.

2000-09-26 11:45  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, main.c: Finally found the course of the
	"missing QUIT message" problem.  Turned out to be me closing the
	client socket before the server socket (which automatically closes
	the server socket - thus the GETFL error too).

2000-09-26 11:31  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/cfgfile.c: Forgot to change a line to enable the config file
	directive

2000-09-26 10:58  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1, src/cfgfile.c,
	src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.h: New config file
	option that sets die_on_close to 1 if set to yes.  Basically means
	that you can use dircproxy without its detachable bit now.

2000-09-25 12:24  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.7.3.

2000-09-25 12:16  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, TODO: Version 0.7.2 released.

2000-09-18 10:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: listen_port problem should return 3 [ port error ]
	not 2 [ config error ] from main.

2000-09-18 10:06  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: The ~/.dircproxyrc file should only be able to be
	read/write/exec by the user.  It has passwords in it.
	
	We don't make the same restrictions for the others though.
	
	thanks to: Scott Bronson <bronson@trestle.com>

2000-09-18 09:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: [ Bug #114688 ] Need to break out of the big
	while() loop as well if we get a matching mask list, otherwise we
	never report success.

2000-09-14 12:27  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.7.2.

2000-09-14 12:14  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Version 0.7.1 released.

2000-09-14 12:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: [ Bug #114352 ] Thought dircproxy had none of
	these pesky format string problems, but one slipped through in the
	late stages.  Oops.

2000-09-04 13:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, doc/dircproxy.1: Cleared up the documentation
	to state that drop_modes 0 *doesn't* unset this option.

2000-09-04 13:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Removal of a mode flag when p->modes is 0
	resulted in core dump.	Fixed this by checking p->modes is set
	BEFORE doing a strchr() on it.

2000-09-04 13:22  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Only do log spinning if log->maxlines isn't 0
	(duh!)

2000-09-01 14:11  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.7.1

2000-09-01 13:40  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, README, TODO: Version 0.7.0 released.

2000-09-01 12:58  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Need string.h

2000-09-01 12:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/crypt.c: Also include string.h

2000-09-01 12:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/crypt.c: Oops, put the #else in the wrong place

2000-09-01 12:19  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Only replace / its not worth replacing ., just
	makes it harder to find the logs

2000-09-01 12:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy.1: Added config file documentation to the man page
	of muchness

2000-09-01 12:16  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.h: New member for stoned checking and log spinning

2000-09-01 12:15  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, src/cfgfile.c, src/dircproxy.h,
	src/irc_server.c: Check for stoned servers

2000-09-01 12:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Put the sick puppy log spin code in

2000-09-01 12:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Pure sugar, say "all" if we're gonna recall the
	whole file cause its small enough

2000-09-01 12:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Can't use the local config file in inetd mode

2000-09-01 12:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README.inetd: Fixed up the text now that /DIRCPROXY PERSIT exists
	for those inetders

2000-08-31 15:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Almost there ...

2000-08-31 15:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Seperated the code to detach a user from
	ircclient_data()
	
	Fixed the 416/461 swapped numeric typo.
	
	Removed the /DQUIT command and added the /DIRCPROXY command in all
	of its glory.
	
	Neatened motd output

2000-08-31 15:32  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_net.c, irc_net.h: Fixed up the dedicate routines to
	make them work sweeter

2000-08-31 15:30  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_log.c, irc_log.h: Added the code to do manual log file
	recollection

2000-08-31 15:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: Makefile.am, help.h: Added in the help text for the
	/DIRCPROXY HELP command

2000-08-30 14:25  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, src/irc_log.c: Recall everything/nothing code added

2000-08-30 14:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Only log the disconnection if they were active
	and authenticated

2000-08-30 14:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/cfgfile.c: Oops, accidental ` in the code

2000-08-30 13:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/crypt.c: Return a value from main()

2000-08-30 13:40  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/Makefile.am: Oops had a typo

2000-08-30 13:40  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Moved this message below the close()

2000-08-30 13:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Added the contrib subdir

2000-08-30 13:30  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/crypt.c: Added new crypt program

2000-08-30 13:14  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Extra comment for clarity

2000-08-30 13:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* contrib/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am: Added a contrib directory that
	will have the simple "crypt" program in it.

2000-08-30 13:09  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Not much left to do now (yay!)

2000-08-30 13:09  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Added in the code to actually send log stuff to
	the client

2000-08-30 12:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Include crypt.h after dircproxy.h to ensure we
	get configure info

2000-08-30 11:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in, src/irc_client.c: Some unixen put crypt() in
	crypt.h, others in unistd.h

2000-08-30 11:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Don't check whether the log file is open (it
	might not be), just check it has a filename.  And to recall, just
	do it and worry later.

2000-08-30 11:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Don't check we have a conn_class, its a
	programming error to call irc_log without one - let it core dump
	and let the bug show

2000-08-30 10:57  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, src/irc_log.c: Quite a few changes to the log code.  Making
	sure that we have a conn_class is probably a good idea, also fixed
	the fact that the other log got our nickname as a filename!
	
	Made irclog_free() and irclog_close() do slightly different things
	(close just closes the file handle, free actually unlinks and
	free's memory).  This is so we can do log->nlines while the user is
	online for !always log files.
	
	Also added the recall code, all except the bit that sends stuff to
	the user.

2000-08-30 10:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.h: Added a quick time_t to ircproxy
	so we know when a proxy session began.	Display in the 003 header
	sent to the client in place of "(unknown)" we had before.

2000-08-30 10:53  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.h, irc_server.c: Added a flag so that
	if the user uses the /MOTD we don't squelch the reply from them. 
	We still squelch any other MOTD that comes from the server though.

2000-08-30 10:51  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Was using conn_class at a pre-authentication
	point without actually checking the client was active.

2000-08-30 10:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dircproxy.h, irc_net.c, irc_net.h, main.c: We've only got 1
	global variable left now, the list of connection classes.  The rest
	are all static to whatever .c file uses it.  At the same time added
	the defaults for motd_* to dircproxy.h

2000-08-30 10:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: Added logo.h to the compilation

2000-08-30 10:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, src/cfgfile.c, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.h,
	src/logo.h: Made the message of the day stats optional, and at the
	same time added some code to display a l33t "dircproxy" logo if
	they want.

2000-08-29 11:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_log.c, irc_log.h, irc_net.c, irc_net.h,
	irc_server.c: New log code is in place, and modified all the other
	bits of code to use the new log code.  Also a few modifications to
	use local_address and away_message properly.

2000-08-29 11:10  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, src/cfgfile.c, src/dircproxy.h, src/main.c:
	Rewrote the log file a bit, and changed the way cfgfile.c works a
	bit.  Made local_address and away_message global options, and added
	in all the new log-related options.  Finally got rid of
	log_autorecall global variable at the same time.  Also by using
	error() instead of printing directly to standard out, may have
	removed the need for the progname global.

2000-08-29 11:04  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Updated the todo file

2000-08-29 11:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RELEASING: Modified to take into account features list and things

2000-08-29 10:45  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, src/dircproxy.h, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.c,
	src/irc_net.h, src/main.c: Added code to reload configuration file
	on a HUP.  Does pretty well everything including kicking off users
	who's passwords have changed, changing the listen port etc.  Only
	thing it doesn't do is move any open log files, but thats an icky
	thing to do anyway imho.

2000-08-29 10:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc, src/cfgfile.c, src/dircproxy.h,
	src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.c, src/irc_net.h: Added new
	drop_modes configuration option to drop user modes on detach.

2000-08-29 10:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Added a new drop_modes config file option for security and
	niceness.

2000-08-29 10:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Added a note about passwords being encrypted

2000-08-29 10:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, conf/dircproxyrc, src/cfgfile.c, src/dircproxy.h,
	src/irc_client.c, src/irc_net.h: Added code and configuration
	option to choose between disconnecting an existing user or denying
	an attempt connect.
	
	At the same time added a new boolean configuration type that can be
	yes/true/y/t/1/no/false/n/f/0 and sets an int to 1 or 0

2000-08-25 10:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RELEASING: Added instruction to copy to ftp

2000-08-25 10:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RELEASING: Added note about running build-site.pl to update the
	website

2000-08-25 09:57  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Ooh, TODO file is getting smaller now

2000-08-25 09:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Updated the configuration file to fit the new
	config stuff

2000-08-25 09:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Use PACKAGE ('dircproxy') not progname
	('../dircproxy-binary') for syslog

2000-08-25 09:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: We must use syslog as soon as possible with inetd

2000-08-25 09:50  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Actually check a channel existed before
	announcing we couldn't rejoin.	I think that a re-use of a "bad
	channel" numeric is causing the "Cannot rejoin +iw" bug, but even
	if its not its a good place to start.

2000-08-25 09:49  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Added the code to seperate the server password
	from the server string, and send it to the server when we connect.

2000-08-25 09:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Use a static function to make a listening port,
	avoids duplication of that rather specialist code.  This is called
	by both ircnet_listen and ircnet_dedicate() and only binds if a
	local_addr is given.

2000-08-25 09:46  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Changed the start order to make it a little more
	realistic

2000-08-25 09:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Changed the config file order to alphabetical

2000-08-25 09:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Argh!  Bloody patch, I knew there was something up
	with it.

2000-08-25 09:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dircproxy.h, irc_client.c, irc_log.c, irc_net.c,
	irc_server.c, main.c, sock.c, sprintf.c: Got rid of the
	DEBUG_SYSCALL_FAIL, DEBUG_SYSCALL_DOH macros and replaced them with
	a simple syscall_fail() function.  Also added a debug() function to
	replace all those #ifdef DEBUG/printf things lying around.  This
	meant adding a couple of headers to a few files too.

2000-08-25 09:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_net.c, irc_net.h: Added a 'serverpassword' member to
	ircproxy

2000-08-25 09:20  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dns.c: Check port has a length.  'server irc.foo:' now means
	use default port, not 0.  This is necessary so that '::' works
	(default port, but with password).

2000-08-25 09:19  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/cfgfile.c: Adjusted the documentation for server, because
	thats gonna be able to have passwords in for the server

2000-08-25 09:15  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy.1: Rearranged the man page so the options are in
	alphaspaghettical order.

2000-08-24 12:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* .cvsignore: COPYING is in cvs ... don't ignore it.

2000-08-24 11:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* COPYING: Physically adding the GNU GPL to the source, its
	automatically included by automake anyway, but I don't really want
	people downloading the CVS without a license, or people's own
	automake's applying a different license.
	
	Everything says its GPL anyway *but* this is just for safety and
	stuff.

2000-08-24 11:33  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: There's sufficient changes so far to warrant a new
	version jump, although not everything I want is in yet.  CVS
	version now 0.7.0.

2000-08-24 11:32  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: TODO changes.

2000-08-24 11:25  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, cfgfile.h, dircproxy.h, main.c: listen_port
	isn't a global variable anymore (yay!)	This means the global
	variables have now been cut right down to essential state
	information (in_background, dedicated_proxy, progname) and the list
	of connection classes (*might* be able to get rid of this last one,
	with any luck)
	
	There's the log_autorecall one lagging still, but thats going with
	the new log code, so I'm not bothering about it right now.

2000-08-24 11:22  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Adjusted the ircnet_listen() function so it
	doesn't close an existing listening socket until its absolutely
	sure that the new listening socket is working perfectly.  This'll
	be handy for a HUP if they change the socket we're listening on.

2000-08-24 11:10  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, dircproxy.h, irc_net.h, irc_server.c, main.c:
	Nearly all options in a config file (except listen_port) can be
	listed in a connection { } now, providing even more customisability
	per connection class.  The ones in the body *above it* are used as
	defaults (below serve as defaults for any further connection
	classes).  This means that all the globals have gone, and are now
	just members of struct ircconnclass.

2000-08-24 11:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Call sock_close() instead of close() just in case.
	 Also ensure we close sockets when freeing a proxy (like when
	SIGTERM or SIGINT is sent).
	
	Due to changes in config file, look for all variables under
	conn_class now (except listen_port), and don't bother with checking
	awaymessage isn't -1.

2000-08-24 09:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy.1: Made the man page even more spiffy, just gotta
	document the configuraton file options (which are changing soon
	anyway!).

2000-08-24 09:15  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/sock.c: Fixed a memory leak if a send() failed to the server.

2000-08-23 14:30  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Only do mem_report stuff if DEBUG_MEMORY is defined,
	although this is generally defined with DEBUG it *might* not be ...

2000-08-23 14:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: dircproxy binary is now installed in 'bin'

2000-08-23 13:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy.1: Neatened the options and added the homepage

2000-08-23 13:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/dircproxy.1: Made the man page a .1

2000-08-23 13:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/: Makefile.am, dircproxy.1, dircproxy.8: Just had a bit of a
	decision change.  dircproxy is now installed under "bin" not
	"sbin", this means the man page is a .1 as well.

2000-08-23 13:30  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* doc/: Makefile.am, dircproxy.1, dircproxy.8: As dircproxy gets
	installed in sbin it should be an (8) man page.

2000-08-23 13:25  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, doc/.cvsignore, doc/Makefile.am,
	doc/dircproxy.1: I figured out how to do it finally and wrote a
	quick man page for dircproxy.  Its not complete, but is pretty good
	by man page standards.

2000-08-23 11:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Changed the password code to make it compile
	without warnings, actually #ifdef'ing out the "if" statement now
	instead of magic with pointers.

2000-08-23 11:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_client.h, irc_net.c, irc_net.h: Moved the
	dedicated_proxy code itself out of irc_client, and into irc_net. 
	Added the function to actually dedicate the proxy to one particular
	proxy session, and also added function to announce if we're not
	listening for connections.

2000-08-23 11:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dircproxy.h, irc_net.c, irc_net.h, main.c: Moved the
	definition of dedicated_proxy from main to irc_net, as its a bit
	more suitable there.  Also made it a simple boolean, not a port,
	because code in irc_net can check the listen_sock itself.

2000-08-23 11:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: Added check for crypt() function in default library
	and in -lcrypt too.

2000-08-23 11:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: Spiffy new readme file

2000-08-23 11:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More stuff todo

2000-08-22 17:09  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More TODO

2000-08-22 16:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More stuff to do *sigh*

2000-08-22 13:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_client.h, src/main.c: Put in the
	code to announce on attach if we're a dedicated proxy.

2000-08-22 12:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Running under inetd means we're backgrounded

2000-08-22 12:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* RFC1459, RFC2810, RFC2811, RFC2812, RFC2813: Added the RFCs to
	CVS so that they are in the developer source, comes in handy for
	me.

2000-08-22 12:46  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dircproxy.h, main.c: New "dedicated_proxy" variable.  Set
	this to be a port number other than 0 if we're a listening daemon
	on a non-standard port that only has one connection class.
	
	(For those people running from inetd or under the planned "user"
	directive)

2000-08-21 14:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Added variable to say whether we're in the background
	or not

2000-08-21 14:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Moved the "join hook" stuff so its activated by
	a 004, and not by the end of a motd.  (Mainly so /motd doesn't
	trigger it :o)

2000-08-21 14:53  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Passwords in the config file are now encrypted
	using crypt(), so use that to compare passwords.

2000-08-21 14:53  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dircproxy.h, irc_prot.h: Moved the OLD_RFC1459_PARAM_SPACE
	definition to dircproxy.h to keep it with the rest of the config
	stuff.
	
	Added a new config directive which says to use encrypted passwords,
	so people can undef it if they want smaff to kill them.

2000-08-21 14:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Fixed a documentation typo

2000-08-21 14:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: updated todo file

2000-08-21 14:37  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* PROTOCOL: Bit of a rewrite of this to make it nicer

2000-08-21 14:36  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* NEWS: Added copyright

2000-08-21 14:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* AUTHORS, INSTALL: Spell checked and fmt'd

2000-08-18 09:20  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* .cvsignore, INSTALL: Added new custom INSTALLation documentation,
	instead of the default autoconf documentation.	Removed INSTALL
	from .cvsignore so we could commit it :o)

2000-08-18 09:20  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* AUTHORS: Doing a bit of a documentation re-work, so changed the
	AUTHORS file.

2000-08-17 16:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* AUTHORS, AUTHORS.map: Removed Stephen as an active developer,
	still kept the credit for work on documentation.

2000-08-17 15:19  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxyrc: Realised that the listen_port config file
	directive has never been in the config file, despite the fact its
	available.  Added it, so people don't have to edit dircproxy.h to
	change the listening port (not that they did anyway)

2000-08-17 15:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: Header file documentation was a bit wrong

2000-08-16 16:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Amended the TODO list

2000-08-16 15:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: Changed filename of system dircproxy config file
	to dircproxyrc from dircproxy.conf

2000-08-16 15:40  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/: Makefile.am, dircproxy.conf, dircproxyrc: Changed the name
	of the default configuration file to dircproxyrc, this will be the
	name of the file wherever it goes (to avoid confusion)

2000-06-28 12:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: [ Bug #108464 ] The character replacement was
	replacing : with :, when it should have been replacing / with :. 
	Oops.

2000-06-26 16:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.6.3

2000-06-26 16:24  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Version 0.6.2 released.

2000-06-26 16:21  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/: Makefile.am, dircproxy.conf, dircproxyrc.example: Adjusted
	these files so they reflect the way things now are.  this file goes
	in share and isn't automatically installed.

2000-06-20 13:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Missed a space in the help text.

2000-06-20 13:40  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Fixed the --help which was wrong

2000-06-20 13:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: Added Debian to the list too

2000-05-29 12:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* AUTHORS, AUTHORS.map: Added Stephen Cope to the AUTHORS files,
	credited for documenting this thing.

2000-05-27 18:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: Played with the VA compile farm, and added all the other
	architectures it offers to this list as its compiled on them all.

2000-05-27 18:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: Added ia64 to the list of platforms, since I got access
	to the ones at VA.

2000-05-25 22:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Changed the logic behind the config file loading a
	bit.  Now if one isn't explicitly specified, it'll use a
	~/.dircproxyrc.  If that doesn't exist it will use
	/etc/dircproxy.conf.  This removed the need for -G.
	
	Also fixed missing options on --config-file= and --port= and made
	-P/--port override the config file

2000-05-25 22:20  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/cfgfile.c: Removed fopen() error message, because we don't
	want to know!

2000-05-25 18:15  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Checking the wrong parameter of a 437... doh!

2000-05-25 14:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.6.2

2000-05-25 14:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Version 0.6.1 released.

2000-05-25 14:00  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/cfgfile.c: Heh who'd have thought an extra semi-colon could
	cause a nasty core dump.

2000-05-25 13:59  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, memdebug.c: MIN() seems to be defined all
	over the place on different platforms.	Just define it here, its
	not hard.

2000-05-25 13:58  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: Added Solaris 2.7 to the platforms list seeing as I have
	an account on one now to test this on.

2000-05-24 22:21  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/cfgfile.c: Argh! > didn't do what I expected here.  This is
	one of those nasty "post release" bugs that causes the thing to
	core dump

2000-05-24 22:19  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: Added FreeBSD 3.4 to this, because I have it running on
	that too

2000-05-24 22:04  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version now 0.6.1

2000-05-24 21:46  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Version 0.6.0 released.

2000-05-24 21:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/dircproxy.conf, conf/dircproxyrc.example, src/dircproxy.h:
	Changed the default rejoin to 15 seconds

2000-05-24 21:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Oops, ignored the listen_port config variable

2000-05-24 21:26  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Updated the todo

2000-05-24 21:21  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.c, irc_net.h: Added code so that an
	inetd socket doesn't linger

2000-05-24 21:08  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Updated the TODO file

2000-05-24 21:06  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Close cleanly on a ^C

2000-05-24 21:03  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Use 'dircproxy' as the source of notices

2000-05-24 21:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: I use notice to notify of nasty system things,
	so I might as well make it come from dircproxy itself.

2000-05-24 20:58  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Oops, msg.cmd is a string not an integer

2000-05-24 20:58  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Neatened the motd output

2000-05-24 20:54  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/cfgfile.c: Fixed it so it doesn't add the server list
	backwards

2000-05-24 20:53  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Fixed the bug where you are rejoined to channels
	in the opposite order to that which you joined them

2000-05-24 20:50  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Fixed the output so it doesn't keep repeating
	itself

2000-05-24 20:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Bit of a bug, forgot to increment l, so if you got
	kicked the last channel you joined, it kinda forgot about the rest
	(oops)

2000-05-24 20:48  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Whoa, scary, I wasn't freeing any log memory -
	talk about memleak! sheesh!

2000-05-24 20:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/memdebug.c: Copied across the neatening from maestro -
	specifically this adds a little bit of code to show what is stored
	in the memory still allocated

2000-05-24 20:31  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Fixed a couple of typo-bugs

2000-05-24 20:30  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.h: Removed dead function definition

2000-05-24 20:29  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Added code for non-recoverable JOIN errors

2000-05-24 20:25  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_server.c: Removed the auto-rejoin code (its in irc_net.c
	now)
	
	Made a special case for the 437 numeric, because it can be either
	nickname or channel related.
	
	Added code so that while a client is detached, we attempt to rejoin
	channels if its full/invite only/banned/juped
	
	Also on join, we can reactive a channel, and then spool the log
	back to the client (in case of kick).

2000-05-24 20:22  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Make log directory on successful first auth now
	- much better place to do it.  Also make the misclog when we loose
	the client.
	
	Added code to spool stats about sizes of log files and channels
	user was on in the message of the day

2000-05-24 20:20  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.c: Moved the code to rejoin channels automatically to
	here.
	
	Moved the misclog code about, this log only gets created when the
	user disconnects now and then is removed when they connect.

2000-05-24 20:18  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_net.h: New 'inactive' variable for channels.	This is set
	to 1 when we are removed from the channel while a client isn't
	connected.  All the time this is one we attempt to rejoin the
	channel every few seconds until the join is successfull or the
	client comes back.

2000-05-24 20:17  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: When closing a log, make sure we set 'open' to 0

2000-05-24 19:11  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/sprintf.c: Need to have some memory allocated to avoid buffer
	underruns, also need to null terminate after strncpy()

2000-05-24 19:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/sprintf.c: Fixed a few bugs

2000-05-24 19:02  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/sprintf.c: Added in an (almost) complete implementation of
	vsprintf()

2000-05-24 19:01  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: When in debug mode, don't even detect vsnprintf(),
	use our own implementation of vsprintf()

2000-05-24 18:30  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: [ Bug #106153 ] compiler error, partial make fix
	
	Added check to see whether socket() is in -lsocket and whether
	gethostbyname() is in -lnsl

2000-05-24 18:18  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: There is a config file now :o)

2000-05-24 18:09  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Updated the TODO file with whats left to do

2000-05-24 18:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_log.c, irc_prot.c, irc_server.c,
	timers.c: Removed a lot of the printf() debug code, that which I
	still want to see I've placed inside #ifdef DEBUG stuff

2000-05-24 17:57  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_client.c, irc_net.h, irc_server.c: Took out all the
	hacky defines and replaced them with the nice sexy config file
	variables

2000-05-24 17:52  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: irc_net.c, irc_net.h: Added new function to clean up a
	connection class structure, and made expunge clean them up too

2000-05-24 17:45  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Whoohoo, lets read some config file baby!

2000-05-24 17:42  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Changed the command line options a bit, especially
	added checks whether to use the global config file or not, and
	alternate local config file.  I've decided not to do all the -p/-s
	stuff because it'll show up in a 'ps' list which isn't a good idea!

2000-05-24 17:39  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dircproxy.h, main.c: Added the global variables and
	initialise them to the values in dircproxy.h Removed those horrid
	TODO_CFG things finally

2000-05-24 17:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Using an ALARM single to stop the main loop was
	pretty pointless, might as well just use the TERM signal which will
	let dircproxy clean itself up if its 'kill'd

2000-05-24 17:31  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: Fixed a mistake in the comments

2000-05-24 17:30  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: Makefile.am, dircproxy.h: Added some defines to set the
	name and locations of the configuration files

2000-05-24 17:28  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: Added the new cfgfile.c and .h files to the
	Makefile

2000-05-24 17:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: Changing CVS version to 0.6.0 seeing as thats the
	version I said the config file code would be in

2000-05-24 17:22  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Added the new conf directory to
	Makefile.am and configure.in

2000-05-24 17:18  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: cfgfile.c, cfgfile.h: Wrote the code to read in a
	configuration file

2000-05-24 17:16  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* conf/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am, dircproxy.conf,
	dircproxyrc.example: Written the default configuration files, and
	everything.  So adding them to CVS :o)

2000-05-24 12:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: More stuff todo, gonna work on a lot of this today

2000-05-14 20:56  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Updated the TODO file based on user-feedback and my own
	grudges

2000-05-14 20:55  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README: Added a quick meme that there is no config file at the
	moment ...
	
	Also fixed the bugs url so its not https

2000-05-13 17:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* AUTHORS.map, RELEASING: Added a file detailing the steps to do a
	new release, to make sure I do it right.  Also added the
	AUTHORS.map file cvs2cl.pl uses.

2000-05-13 16:20  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version becomes 0.5.5 (although potentially
	might be 0.6 if no more bugs appear and I can work on the config
	file).

2000-05-13 16:14  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, configure.in: Version 0.5.4 released.

2000-05-13 16:11  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/main.c: Logic on the -D option was wrong, should set
	no_daemon to 1.

2000-05-13 16:05  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/match.c: Requires sprintf.c because it uses strdup()

2000-05-13 16:04  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in, src/sprintf.c: If --enable-debug is set, we
	actually don't want to check for strdup(), that way we are only
	checking for vsnprintf() and the code at the top of sprintf.c isn't
	required.  (This gets rid of all those pesky "Free of illegal
	block" messages).

2000-05-13 15:47  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, TODO: Version 0.5.3 released.

2000-05-13 05:25  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in, src/dns.c, src/irc_client.c, src/irc_log.c,
	src/irc_net.c, src/irc_prot.c, src/irc_server.c, src/irc_string.c,
	src/match.c, src/sprintf.c, src/sprintf.h, src/timers.c: Using
	strdup() isn't entirely portably apparently, and also it pisses off
	memdebug.c something chronic.  Check for it in configure.in, and
	use it as x_strdup() everwhere.  If it does exist, x_strdup() is
	just a wrapper for strdup(), if it doesn't exist, or DEBUG_MEMORY
	is defined, then it does its own malloc/strcpy.

2000-05-13 05:12  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dircproxy.h, irc_client.c, irc_prot.c, irc_server.c,
	main.c: Made some of the TODO_CFG macros into the proper macros
	they will be as the defaults for the config file.  Gave them
	documentation too.
	
	Also added two FALLBACK defines for those things not in the config
	file that I/users might want to change

2000-05-13 04:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/.cvsignore: Added the name of the executable to the ignore
	file

2000-05-13 04:43  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: fchmod() doesn't take a FILE *, grrr.
	
	Changed to just chmod() the filename, seeing as we have that anyway

2000-05-13 04:41  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/: dns.c, irc_client.c, irc_log.c, irc_net.c, irc_prot.c,
	irc_server.c, irc_string.c, match.c, timers.c: Decided to embrace
	the fruit that is strdup() and in the process cleaned up a lot of
	code (yay!)

2000-05-13 04:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_log.c: Heh, anyone on the machine could not only see what
	channels you were on, not only read everything on those channels,
	they could also read your private messages.
	
	This isn't good.  Made the dir be created 0700 and files 0600 now.

	* src/irc_client.c: Set bind to 0 after strdup(), heh

2000-05-13 04:13  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/irc_client.c: Fixed a missing bracket problem that crept in
	and prevented compilation...  doh! damned "TODO" code

2000-05-13 04:07  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/sock.c: Made the calls to set/unset non blocking a bit more
	friendly.  Also we now block when doing a send() otherwise we loose
	data (doh!)

2000-05-13 02:38  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* src/dircproxy.h: PACKAGE and VERSION will always be defined in
	config.h unless something has really gone wrong, and that'll need
	fixing anyway.	Define them in the elsif to save code and make
	things look neeter.

2000-05-13 02:34  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* README, src/main.c: Changed the homepage and bug reporting
	locations now we're all fully sourceforge'd up

2000-05-13 02:28  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.in: CVS version is 0.5.3

2000-05-13 02:23  Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>

	* .cvsignore, FILES.autoconf, src/.cvsignore: Removed the
	FILES.autoconf file, and replaced it with a .cvsignore in each
	directory.  This means that 'cvs update' etc will ignore any files
	generated by auto{conf,make}.  This is a good-thing.  Means you can
	run autogen.sh on your checked out version without it getting in
	the way of CVS.
