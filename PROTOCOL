IRC has been for a long time notoriously undocumented.  The original
RFC1459 ("Internet Relay Chat Protocol") was written back in May 1993
and since then IRC has changed quite a bit, especially in the numerics
returned by servers.

These were (thankfully) updated to the modern 2.10 IRC protocol in
April 2000.  Where they differ (in a few places) dircproxy follows
the newer RFCs.  They are (for reference):

RFC2810  Internet Relay Chat: Architecture
RFC2811  Internet Relay Chat: Channel Management
RFC2812  Internet Relay Chat: Client Protocol
RFC2813  Internet Relay Chat: Server Protocol

Currently noted differences:
  The USER command:  1459 says that parameters 2 and 3 are the hostname and
  servername.  These haven't been used for years.  RFC2812 changes this to
  define the second parameter as a bit mask to set +w or +i mode by default,
  and makes the 3rd parameter unused.
  dircproxy ignores the 3rd parameter, and performs an atoi() on the second.
  If the second isn't 0 then it assumes the client follows RFC2812 and treats
  the bits according to that standard.  Otherwise it discards it.
  dircproxy always sends "0 *" to the server for these paramters.

  001 thru 004:  These were not defined in 1459, but are in 2812.  All servers
  send these.  dircproxy requires them so it knows when its connected to the
  server.

  Parameter Spacing:  1459 says parameters can be seperated by one or more
  spaces.  2812 says only by one space.  dircproxy by default follows 2812
  on this, because it seems to be better.  If this causes you some real 
  problems then define the OLD_RFC1459_PARAM_SPACE macro in irc_prot.h
