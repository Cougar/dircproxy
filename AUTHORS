Most of the code in this program is written by me, some if it
is taken from "davinci" which was also written by me.

A big thanks to Stephen Cope <kimihia@writeme.com> for doing the
original documentation for dircproxy.

If you have contributed any major patches or enhancements, remind
me to add you here.
