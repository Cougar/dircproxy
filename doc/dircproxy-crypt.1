.SH NAME
\fBdircproxy-crypt\fR \- Generate encrypted password for \fBdircproxy\fR

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdircproxy-crypt\fR
[\fB-hv\fR]
[\fBpassword\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dircproxy-crypt
generates encrypted passwords for the
.BR dircproxy (1)
configuration file.  These passwords are used in the '\fBpassword\fR'
configuration option of a connection class, and are compared to the
password you configure your IRC client to use.
.PP
If you do not supply any plain text passwords to encrypt on the command
line then \fBdircproxy-crypt\fR, when run, will ask you for one on
standard input.  It will display the encrypted version of each password,
created using your system's
.BR crypt (3)
function and a random salt, on standard output.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Displays a brief help message detailing the command-line arguments,
then exits.
.TP
.B -v
Displays the \fBdircproxy\fR version number that this version of
\fBdircproxy-crypt\fR comes with, then exits.
