dircproxy: Detchable IRC Proxy Server
-------------------------------------

dircproxy is a detachable IRC proxy server designed for those people
who use IRC from different workstations, or different clients.  You
connect to IRC through dircproxy, and it will keep you connected to
the server, even after you disconnect.  While you're detached it logs
both channel and private messages, and important events for you.
When you reattach, it downloads them to you as if they'd just arrived.
This gives it roughly the same functionality as using ircII and screen
on a permanently connected host, but gives you the advantage of using
whatever irc client you like (especially X ones).


It supports all the usual things like optional dcc rewriting for those
people behind firewalls (it can be switched off if you like though),
binding to a different host on your machine, and continually attempting
reconnection to an irc server if the connection is lost.  It also
supports some neat features, such as proxying for multiple people (so
you only need install it once per machine), rejoining channels when kicked
and setting you /AWAY while you are detached.

You need to make no changes to your IRC client for this to work.  You
connect to dircproxy as the server, supplying a password using the
PASS command, which all IRC client's should support.  Upon a successful
connection, dircproxy will either reattach you to your left session, or
begin connection to the irc server specificied in the configuration file
for your password.

Advanced users might want to use the /DIRCPROXY command, which allows you to
manipulate the proxy, as well as read back through the logs.  There are 
configuration files for various clients in the contrib directory that provide
easy shortcuts for the /DIRCPROXY commands.


See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.


I have personally got this compiling on the following architectures:

	i586-pc-linux-gnu	Linux 2.2 with glibc 2.0 (RedHat 5.2)
	i686-pc-linux-gnu	Linux 2.2-SMP with glibc 2.2 (RedHat 6.2)
	i386-unknown-freebsd4.0	FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE

If you get it to compile on any others (it should) then please let me know
so I can add them to the list.  Send me the output of the "config.guess"
script along with your brief description of the machine type and I'll add
it to the list.  Thanks.
