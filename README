dircproxy: Detachable IRC Proxy Server
-------------------------------------

dircproxy is an IRC proxy server designed for people who use IRC
from lots of different workstations or clients, but wish to remain
connected and see what they missed while they were away.  You connect
to IRC through dircproxy, and it keeps you connected to the server,
even after you detach your client from it.  While you're detached,
it logs channel and private messages as well as important events,
and when you re-attach it'll let you know what you missed.

This can be used to give you roughly the same functionality as
using ircII and screen together, except you can use whatever IRC
client you like, including X ones!


Features
========

 o Runs on console, as daemon and from inetd
 o Can proxy for multiple people at once
 o Can bind proxy sessions to any IP on the server
 o Uses IRC server passwords to authenticate.  No need to use any
   special commands
 o Can proxy DCC chats and sends, altering the visible IP address so
   it completely hides your actual address.
 o Can proxy DCC chats and sends across ssh tunnels, for those people
   behind restrictive firewalls.  See README.dcc-via-ssh for
   information on this magic.
 o Can capture DCC sends on the server, instead of sending them on to
   you.  Especially useful when you're detached.
 o Logs are stored on disk in human-readable format, either in a
   temporary directory, or stored for prosperity in a directory of
   your choice.
 o Logs can contain everything that occurs, or just what happens
   while you're detached.
 o Logs are spooled in ordinary IRC protocol format for optimal
   reading
 o Logs can be automatically spooled on reconnect, to fill your window
   up giving you a "scroll-back"
 o Logs can be manually recalled and played back using a special
   command.
 o Log file size can be limited automatically
 o Messages can be time-stamped in log files.
 o Can connect to servers that require a password
 o Will automatically reconnect to the server if connection is dropped
 o Will automatically rejoin channels for you if you're kicked
 o Will reconnect to servers if they become "stoned".
 o Can drop modes for you when you detach
 o Sets you /AWAY when you detach with a custom away message
 o Host and Password based connection security
 o Easy to configure and get going

dircproxy is currently under development, so many more features will
be added as it progresses.


Installation
============

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.


Running dircproxy
=================


Once you have installed and configured dircproxy, you can run it
from the console.  It will automatically enter the background
(unless you supply the '-D' parameter) and begin listening for
incoming connections.

You should not need to modify your IRC client or add any
special scripts to support dircproxy.  Authentication is done
using the standard IRC server password, your IRC client should
support this. If you're not sure, try something like '/server
localhost:57000:password' from your IRC client's console.

Connect to it with your IRC client, supplying the same password as
you set in the config file, dircproxy will then connect to the IRC
server for you and begin proxying your session.

When you detach, dircproxy will remain running and remain connected
to the IRC server, logging any channel or private messages for you
until your return.

To re-attach, just connect with your IRC client, again supplying
the password.  dircproxy will see you have left a session running and
re-attach you to that instead of creating a new one.  Messages you
missed while you were away will be sent to you in such a way that
they will fill your IRC windows as if they'd just arrived.


You can also run dircproxy from inetd if you wish, although their
are very few reasons to do this.  See the file README.inetd for
more information on this feature.


Adjusting the Proxy
===================

While you are connected to the proxy you may perform a number of
actions to adjust your proxy session using the '/dircproxy' command.
For example, to end your proxy session, disconnecting you from the
server, use '/dircproxy quit'.  For more information on what other
commands are available, see '/dircproxy help'.
